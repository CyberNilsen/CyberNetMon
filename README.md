   - The status indicator will show "ACTIVE" when monitoring is running
   - Connection data will populate automatically

3. **View Connections**
   - Monitor live connections in the main table
   - Color coding indicates threat levels:
     - üü¢ Green: Normal connections
     - üü° Yellow: Potentially suspicious
     - üî¥ Red: High-risk connections

4. **Export Data**
